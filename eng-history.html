        HISTORY OF ENGINEERING
      </center>
    </h1>
    Engineering is the practice of using natural science, mathematics and engineering design processes to solve technical problems, increase efficiency and productivity, and improve systems. Modern engineering comprises many subfields which include designing and improving infrastructure, machinery, vehicles, electronics, materials and energy systems. The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialised fields of engineering each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application. The term engineering is derived from the latin word ingenium, meaning "cleverness" and ingeniare, meaning "to contrive, devise".
    <br><br>
    Engineering is nothing but the creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilising them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behaviour under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.
    <br><br>
    Engineering has existed since ancient times, when humans  devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley, etc.
    The term engineering is derived from the word engineer, which itself dates back to the 14th century when an engineer (literally, one who builds or operates aslege enginer) referred to "a constructor of military engines' '. In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, i.e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a catapult). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, e.g., the U.S Army Corps Of Engineers. Later, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term civil engineering entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specialising in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of military engineering.
    <br><br>


    The six classic simple machines were known in the ancient Near East. The wedge and the inclined plane (ramp) were known since prehistoric times. The wheel, along with the wheel and axle  mechanism, was invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC. The lever  mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology.
    <br><br>
    The lever was also used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia c. 3000 BC and then in ancient Egyptian technology   c. 2000 BC. The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC, and ancient Egyptian during the twelfth dynasty (1991–1802 BC). The screw, the last of the simple machines to be invented, first appeared in Mesopotamia during the neo-Assyrian period (911–609) BC. The Egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever, to create structures like theGreat Pyramid Of Giza.
    <br><br>
    The earliest practical wind-powered machines, the windmill and wind pump, first appeared in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age, in what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by the 9th century AD. The earliest practical steam-powered machine was a steam jack driven by steam turbine , described in 1551 by Taqi Al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma’ruf in Ottoman Egypt.
