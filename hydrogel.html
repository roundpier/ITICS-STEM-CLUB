        HYDROGEL: IS IT THE NEW SOLUTION?
      </center>
    </h1>

    Hydrogels can be defined as materials formed by a porous three-dimensional network prepared from crosslinked natural or synthetic hydrophilic polymers that hold large quantities of water or biological fluids in their structure without dissolving. They are also referred to as aqua gels.
<br>
<br />
The first reported hydrogel can be traced back to 1960, when Wichterle and Lim synthesised poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) and utilised it in the contact lens industry with the ability of imbibing moisture while asserting its network structure, demonstrating the modern hydrogel. Hydrogels have been used in the development of all four types of devices, classified by release mechanism:
<ul>

<li>
diffusion controlled, both reservoir and monolithic
</li>
<li>
chemically controlled release, i.e., bioerodible carriers
</li>
<li>
solvent-controlled release, where swelling of the matrix is the mechanism enabling the entrapped drug out
</li>
<li>
externally controlled release
</li></ul>
<br />
<br>
The most recent issue we are facing is microplastics. Microplastics can be hazardous to human health. These tiny plastic debris can enter our body through the water we drink and increase the risk of illness. They are also an environmental hazard; found even in remote areas like polar ice caps and deep ocean trenches, they endanger aquatic and terrestrial lifeforms.
<br>
<br />
To combat this pollutant, researchers at Indian Institute of Science(IISc) have designed a sustainable hydrogel to remove microplastics,with a unique polymer network and nanoclusters to degrade contaminants. The hydrogel can efficiently remove up to 95% of microplastics and be repurposed into carbon nanomaterials for heavy metal removal.
<br>
<br />
The sustainable hydrogel designed by the researchers has a unique intertwined polymer network that can bind the contaminants and degrade them using UV light irradiation.
Scientists have previously tried using filtering membranes to remove microplastics.
<br>
<br />
However, the membranes can become clogged with these tiny particles, rendering them unsustainable. Instead, the IISc team led by Suryasarathi Bose, Professor at the Department of Materials Engineering, decided to turn to 3D hydrogels. The IISc said the novel hydrogel developed by the team consists of three different polymer layers – chitosan, polyvinyl alcohol and polyaniline – intertwined together, making an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) architecture. The team infused this matrix with nanoclusters of a material called copper substitute polyoxometalate (Cu-POM). These nanoclusters are catalysts that can use UV light to degrade the microplastics. The combination of the polymers and nanoclusters resulted in a strong hydrogel with the ability to adsorb and degrade large amounts of microplastics.
<br>
<br />
The hydrogel was found to be highly efficient – it could remove about 95% and 93% of two different types of microplastics in water at near-neutral pH (∼6.5). The team also carried out several experiments to test how durable and strong the material was. They found that the combination of the three polymers made it stable under various temperatures.
<br>
<br />
Scientists have proved that hydrogel can be the new solution to a hazardous issue mankind is facing. Hydrogel will help in removing these harmful microplastics and make a better future for the coming generation.But preventive measures to stop using plastic must be taken by the citizens.
