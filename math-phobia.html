        MATH PHOBIA EXISTS: DYSCALCULIA
      </center>
    </h1>
    Math Phobia, also known as mathematical anxiety, is a feeling of tension and anxiety that interferes with the manipulation of numbers and the solving of mathematical problems in daily life and academic situations. Even kids who have strong math skills can experience math anxiety. It’s different from dyscalculia, but the signs can look similar. Math anxiety is more than getting stressed out over a math test. It’s an intense feeling of worry or fear people have when they have to do a math task. It can happen at home, at school, or at work. Math anxiety is very common. According to a 2018 review, approximately 93% of adults in the United States say that they have experienced some degree of math anxiety. Additionally, an estimated 17% of U.S. residents have a severe form of the condition.
    <br>
    Dyscalculia is a learning difference that causes trouble with math. But dyscalculia isn’t the same as math anxiety. Math anxiety can make kids question their abilities in math, even if they have strong skills.Even though dyscalculia and math anxiety are different,the signs can overlap. And it’s possible for someone to have both.
    <br>
    Major causes of math anxiety include:
    <ul>

    <li><b>The pressure caused by time limits on tests:</b> The deadlines that timed tests impose on students lead them to feel anxious. This leads them to forget concepts that they have no problem remembering at home. Since these tests can have a negative impact on grades, the student’s fear of failure is confirmed. This creates a vicious circle that can be difficult to break.</li>
    <li><b>The fear of public embarrassment:</b> Math anxiety has also been linked to negative emotions from the past. If a student has been scolded for getting an answer wrong, it can make his or her anxiety worse. The same is true if he or she has been embarrassed in front of others.</li>
    <li><b>Influence of teachers:</b> Students can also pick up on their teacher’s feelings about math. If a teacher is excited and positive.</li>
  </ul>
    <br>
    Symptoms of Math Anxiety :
    <ul>


    <li>  Unusual nervousness when doing or thinking about mathematics</li>
    Passive behaviour</li>
    <li>Low grades </li>
    <li>Panic during tests or while answering questions</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br />
    Breathing exercises, writing worries down, and practising math in an encouraging, low-pressure environment may help a person manage their anxiety.Many schools use tutoring programs to manage math anxiety. The main focus of this tutoring is usually to help with a student’s math ability. Although they do not directly address how a person thinks or feels about math, some may find it helpful to have this additional support.
    <br>
    Math anxiety is a common experience. It causes a person to feel worried or panicked about solving math problems, which makes it harder to think. This leads to a cycle of low confidence and anxiety that can affect school or work performance.However, many anxiety treatments may also generally help with math anxiety. People can also ask a doctor about CBT or exposure therapy. For children, changes in the classroom or at home may also be beneficial.
