        THE FUNDAMENTALS OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY SIMPLIFIED
      </center>
    </h1>

    <BR />
    <BR />
    Organic chemistry is a branch/division of chemistry which involves the scientific study of the structure, properties and reactions of organic compounds & materials, which contain carbon in covalent bonding. The study of structure determines their chemical composition and formula and the study of properties includes physical and chemical properties, and evaluation of chemical reactivity to understand their behaviour. The study of organic reactions includes the chemical synthesis of natural products, drugs, and polymers, and study of individual organic molecules in the laboratory and via theoretical study. Organic chemistry is the largest area of specialisation among the various fields of chemistry.
<br>
<br>
Sources of Organic compounds are mainly from the nature as it suggests in it name.The sources are plants (sugar,starch, cellulose), animals (urea,proteins),coal, petroleum, fermentation (ethyl alcohol & acetic acid) and wood (methyl alcohol and acetone).
<br>
<br>
Organic compounds are extremely useful to us in our daily life.The soaps and shampoos we use while taking bath, the powder,perfumes, the clothes we wear, food we eat,fuels we use, natural gas, petroleum products, medicines, explosives, dyes, insecticides are all organic compounds. There is hardly any walk of life where we do not need organic compounds.
<br>
<br>
<b>Unique properties of Carbon compounds:</b>
<ul>
<li>TETRAVALENCY OF CARBON :This characteristic of carbon atom, by virtue of which it forms four covalent bonds is called tetravalency of carbon</li>
<li>CATENATION : The property of self-linking of atoms of an element through covalent bonds in order to form straight chains, branched chains and cyclic chains of different sizes.</li>
<li>ISOMERISM : Two or more compounds of carbon can have same molecular formula but they have differences in their structure, e.g.Glucose and Fructose - C₆H₁₂O₆</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>The physical properties of organic compounds :</b>
<ul>
<li>Melting and boiling properties
Organic compounds typically melt and many boil. Some organic compounds, especially symmetrical ones, are sublime. A well-known example of a sublimable organic compound is para-dichlorobenzene.Organic compounds are usually not very stable at temperatures above 300 °C, although some exceptions exist.</li>
<li>Solubility
Neutral organic compounds tend to be hydrophobic. Exceptions include organic compounds that contain ionizable groups as well as low molecular weight alcohols, amines, and carboxylic acids where hydrogen bonding occurs. Otherwise, organic compounds tend to dissolve in organic solvents. Solubility varies widely with the organic solute and with the organic solvent.</li>
<li>Solid state properties
Various specialised properties of molecular crystals and organic polymers with conjugated systems are of interest depending on applications.</li>
</ul>
<br>

Organic compounds form the basis of all earthly life and constitute the majority of known chemicals. The bonding patterns of carbon , with its valence of four—formal single, double, and triple bonds, plus structures with delocalized electrons—make the array of organic compounds structurally diverse, and their range of applications enormous. They form the basis of, or are constituents of, many commercial products including pharmaceuticals; petrochemicals and agrichemicals, and products made from them including lubricants, solvents; plastics; fuels and explosives. The study of organic chemistry overlaps organometallic chemistry and biochemistry, but also with medicinal chemistry, polymer chemistry/synthetic chemistry and materials science.
