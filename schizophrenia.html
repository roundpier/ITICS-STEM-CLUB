        SCHIZOPHRENIA: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
      </center>
    </h1>
    Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behaviour that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling.
    Symptoms develop gradually and typically begin during young adulthood and are never resolved.
    <br>
    <br>
    Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterised by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behaviour. Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative and cognitive symptoms.The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms.
    <br>
    <br>
    Persistent hallucinations,delusions and highly disorganised behaviour are considered as positive symptoms. Negative symptoms are such as very limited speech, restricted experience and expression of emotions, inability to experience interest or pleasure and social withdrawal. Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present.
    <br>
    <br>
    Schizophrenia affects approximately 24 million people or 1 in 300 people (0.32%) worldwide. This rate is 1 in 222 people (0.45%) among adults (2). It is not as common as many other mental disorders. Onset is most often during late adolescence and the twenties, and onset tends to happen earlier among men than among women. Schizophrenia is frequently associated with significant distress and impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, and other important areas of life.
    <br>
    <br>
    Psychiatrists have now explored more in his field and have diagnosed different types of schizophrenia. They are:
    <br>
    <ul>
  <li>  Schizotypal personality disorder</li>
    <li>Delusional disorder</li>
    <li>Brief Psychotic disorder</li>
    <li>Schizophreniform</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br />
    Research has not identified one single cause of schizophrenia. It is thought that an interaction between genes and a range of environmental factors may cause schizophrenia.  Psychosocial factors may also affect the onset and course of schizophrenia. Heavy use of cannabis is associated with an elevated risk of the disorder. Estimates of the heritability of schizophrenia are between 70% and 80%, which implies that 70% to 80% of the individual differences in risk of schizophrenia are associated with genetics. Environmental factors, each associated with a slight risk of developing schizophrenia in later life include oxygen deprivation, infection, prenatal maternal stress, and malnutrition in the mother during prenatal development. Use of stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine can lead to a temporary stimulant psychosis, which presents very similarly to schizophrenia. Rarely, alcohol use can also result in a similar alcohol-related psychosis.
    <br>
    <br>


    Most people with schizophrenia are not aggressive, and are more likely to be victims of violence rather than perpetrators. People with schizophrenia are commonly exploited and victimised by violent crime as part of a broader dynamic of social exclusion. People diagnosed with schizophrenia are also subject to forced drug injections, seclusion, and restraint at high rates.
    <br>
    <br>

    There's no sure way to prevent schizophrenia, but sticking with the treatment plan can help prevent relapses or worsening of symptoms. In addition, researchers hope that learning more about risk factors for schizophrenia may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.
